# xlibc

## Introduction

XLIBC provide some C container libraries which have the following features:

- Cross-platform (using standard C library)
- Potable (no thirdparty dependency and no dependency with each other container)
- Efficient (can be more faster than some C++ STL, see `stl_test.cpp`/`xlist_test.c`/`xhash_test.c`/`xrbtree_test.c`)

## Usage

All container have a sample (xxx_test.c), just read it.

## Build

Just run command 'make'.
